# date_vec

Input numeric values for day, month, year and total days.
Customize the format of the date: choose between "d", "m", "y", "dm", "mdy" or "dmy".
Choose the character string that will separate the terms (only valid when format is "dm", "mdy" or "dmy").

The function outputs a character vector of length defined in total_days, each element representing
a date, starting from the day, month and year chosen by the user, with a particular format also 
defined by the user.
